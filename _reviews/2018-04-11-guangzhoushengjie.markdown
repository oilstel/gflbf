If you scroll fast the page is filled with images of the Alibaba face, probably the most inscruitable logo I can think of. It feels wrong in such a beautiful way. Once it loads it only gets better; for instance, a dark green circle with a jarringly red "WHY US" in the center. The link leads to the contact page, with no information on why one should pick them. Is it actually a cry: "WHY ME"? Certification forms on desert islands and a man playing golf, GREEN WALL #3, etc. A joy to behold.
