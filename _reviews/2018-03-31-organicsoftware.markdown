Seeing Seth Price talk was chill but not particularly productive. Not his fault, just the nature of the medium. My first thought when I saw the site was that I got the wrong url or it was an expired domain, which was my favorite part. I mean the design, which you can't talk about at a talk. I'm not too interested in the aimless critique of the project, and the faux-tech bro About page was a little heavy-handed.
