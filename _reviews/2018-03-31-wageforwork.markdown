Wage for work. Another day another penny. The last piece of pie is long gone. This new museum of work is only accessible against a thin veneer of charcoal or is it spray paint? It could be spray paint but this calculated medium never drips off the cursor. I open a new tab and go to the Wayback Machine to make sure this website is the same [Org I once knew](https://web.archive.org/web/20130522162550/http://www.wageforwork.com/). It’s 2018, all good Org websites must go.
