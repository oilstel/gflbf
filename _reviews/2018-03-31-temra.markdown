An extruded silver plate spreads out in all directions, unaware of the screen. The origin is hard to make out. The metadata is limited. 2.jpg found within the /inscr directory and now resting on the index page. As I walk, I no longer remember what the top looked like. Is it inditical to the bottom of the plate? It's easier to see if you flip the page. Is Temra is here, occupying this page and listening? A global software named Temra and an individual. Did your parents buy this domain on the day of your birth, renewed on your birthday? How do you celebrate your domain’s life when you are connected from birth?
