At long last, I found it, Joel’s Sand Dispensary, which touts “particle sized Silica available by the grain” and delivers. A lot of information, but never in a heap, this website’s particulate structure allows the curious visitor to parse at their own discretion. Nothing fancy, save for one ornate letter “J.” Finally, a website with appropriately sized-text.
