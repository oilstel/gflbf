I happen to know Joel Dean personally, which is why I was pretty surprised when I logged on to joeldean.info and found no legible info regarding Joel Dean at all. However, once I allowed google to translate the page from Japanese to English, the site turned out to be a kind of blog about life in Fukuoka, Japan ridden with unsettling misogynistic language. I believe it is safe to assume this website has nothing to do with the Joel Dean (of Atlanta, Georgia) that I know, and I hope to never meet the Joel Dean (of Fukuoka, Japan).
