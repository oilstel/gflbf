As Harry learns more and more about the sinister forces that threaten the wizarding world. The characters begin to get more developed and more complex, and an awful lot more interesting. I must warn you though, that once you begin, you'll find it almost impossible to stop! Once you finish, you'll be skimming through it again, finding seemingly obvious clues, thinking 'How did I miss that?!'.
