“I know my fair complexion makes it seem like I have a delicate constitution”. txt2re.com is a mind map written on a bathroom stall. “knowing is obsolete” is scratched on the mirror and colorful pill boxes line the bathroom counter. Try to unlearn the computer in front of you. Unplug the keyboard and mouse. Navigate the contours of your face instead. You are a sallow expression framed by a long dark header. “you will meet problems that this site does not solve!”
